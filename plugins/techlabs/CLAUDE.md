## Sprint Orchestrator Framework

End-to-end sprint execution with automatic agent dispatch:

```
PLANNING PHASE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

start → brainstorm → create-prd → project-planning
  ↓
choose-stack → choose-frontend → choose-messaging
  ↓
create-architecture → api-design
  ↓
create-epics → user-stories → sprint-plan
  ↓
sprint-orchestrator


EXECUTION PHASE (per story):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

story-readiness → dispatch-story → dev-story
  ↓ (specialist agent)
review-gate → gate-check → qa-plan → story-done


REVIEW PHASE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

milestone-review → post-mortem → sprint-status
```

## Dispatch Matrix

Each skill automatically routes to the right specialist:

| Phase | Skill | Agents |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Discovery | brainstorm | product-director, lead-engineer, design-lead |
| Product | create-prd | product-director, lead-engineer, security-lead |
| Architecture | create-architecture | lead-engineer, technical-director |
| Build | create-worker | cloudflare-specialist |
| Build | create-nextjs | nextjs-specialist, ui-engineer |
| Build | auth-setup | auth-engineer, security-engineer |
| Review | security-audit | security-engineer, lead-engineer |
| Review | code-review | lead-engineer, security-engineer |
| Release | release-checklist | devops-lead, lead-engineer, security-lead |

## Quality Gates

Every story goes through automated quality gates:

1. **Story Readiness** - Is the story ready to implement?
2. **Code Review** - Code quality, architecture alignment
3. **Automated QA** - Tests, lint, types, coverage
4. **Security Review** - If security-related
5. **Manual QA** - If needed
6. **Story Done** - Final verification

## Collaboration Protocol

**User-driven, not autonomous.**

Every task: **Question → Options → Decision → Draft → Approval**

- Ask before Write/Edit
- Show drafts before approval
- Multi-file changes need explicit approval
- No commits without user instruction
