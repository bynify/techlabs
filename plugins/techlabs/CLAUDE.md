# TechLabs by Bynify

Technology studio framework for Claude Code. 98 agents, 211 skills, 23 hooks, 18 rules.

## CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW

**STRICT WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT:**

1. **READ SKILL FIRST** - When user types `/command`, READ `skills/{command}/SKILL.md` BEFORE responding
2. **FOLLOW ALL STEPS** - NEVER skip steps, NEVER assume
3. **MANDATORY GATES** - All questions MUST be asked, drafts MUST be shown, approval MUST be received
4. **DISPATCH AGENTS** - If skill has "Agents to Dispatch", LOAD agent definition first
5. **UPDATE STATE** - After EVERY action, update session state
6. **ERROR HANDLING** - If something fails, STOP, report, ask for guidance
7. **CHUNK WRITES** - Write/edit in small chunks (max 20 lines for edit, 50 for write)
8. **KNOWLEDGE BASE** - All agents MUST load knowledge base before implementation

**SKILLS vs KNOWLEDGE BASE:**
- Skills = HOW to do it (workflow, steps, quality gates)
- Knowledge Base = WHAT to do it with (documentation, patterns, best practices)
- Skills define process, Knowledge Base provides reference
- Agents load Knowledge Base automatically when dispatched
- Skills don't need to explicitly reference Knowledge Base

**NEVER:**
- Skip reading the skill file
- Skip mandatory questions
- Write without user approval
- Proceed with errors
- Assume without asking
- Implement without loading knowledge base

## Sprint Orchestrator Framework

End-to-end sprint execution with automatic agent dispatch:

```
PLANNING PHASE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

start → brainstorm → create-prd → project-planning
  ↓
choose-stack → choose-frontend → choose-messaging
  ↓
create-architecture → api-design
  ↓
create-epics → user-stories → sprint-plan
  ↓
sprint-orchestrator


EXECUTION PHASE (per story):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

story-readiness → dispatch-story → dev-story
  ↓ (specialist agent)
review-gate → gate-check → qa-plan → story-done


REVIEW PHASE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

milestone-review → post-mortem → sprint-status → sprint-transition

SESSION CONTINUITY:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

start-day → (auto-load session state) → continue work
```

## Dispatch Matrix

Each skill automatically routes to the right specialist:

| Phase | Skill | Agents |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Discovery | brainstorm | product-director, lead-engineer, design-lead |
| Product | create-prd | product-director, lead-engineer, security-lead |
| Architecture | create-architecture | lead-engineer, technical-director |
| Build | create-worker | cloudflare-specialist |
| Build | create-nextjs | nextjs-specialist, ui-engineer |
| Build | auth-setup | auth-engineer, security-engineer |
| Review | security-audit | security-engineer, lead-engineer |
| Review | code-review | lead-engineer, security-engineer |
| Release | release-checklist | devops-lead, lead-engineer, security-lead |

## Quality Gates

Every story goes through automated quality gates:

1. **Story Readiness** - Is the story ready to implement?
2. **Code Review** - Code quality, architecture alignment
3. **Automated QA** - Tests, lint, types, coverage
4. **Security Review** - If security-related
5. **Manual QA** - If needed
6. **Story Done** - Final verification

## Collaboration Protocol

**User-driven, not autonomous.**

Every task: **Question → Options → Decision → Draft → Approval**

- Ask before Write/Edit
- Show drafts before approval
- Multi-file changes need explicit approval
- No commits without user instruction
